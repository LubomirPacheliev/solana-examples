1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be shit.

2. Being shit includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

- Tracking and storing personally identifying data about users.
- Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
- Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being a dick.
- Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER dick.

Obviously, this clearly cuts out a few companies and people who are clearly shit. Here are some examples:

- Facebook
- Microsoft
- Google
- Apple
- The Australian Government
- Craig Wright

None of you can use this software or derivatives of it. Ever.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. If you don't like something about this code, fix it, learn to code, or shut up.

Thanks and have a nice day. <3
